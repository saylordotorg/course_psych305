**Unit 3: E.L. Thorndike: The Original Connectionism** <span
id="3"></span> 
E.L. Thorndike is an important figure in learning theory.  Thorndike had
many original contributions and was seen as a pioneer among pioneers.  A
few of his many notable contributions include The Law of Effect,
psychological connectionism and intellectual measurement.  The Law of
Effect demonstrated that satisfaction after responses strengthened the
likelihood of response.  Additionally, Thorndike’s psychological
connectionism was a highly influential perspective.   The emphasis was
on the internal neural transactions or connections were formed between
perceived stimuli and emitted responses.  Indeed, how effectively an
organism could develop these connections was the foundation of
intellect.  This emphasis on connections was also externalized.  He did
not believe that intelligence could be measured independently of
culture.  We can find the threads of much of thinking within many
contemporary areas of learning and general psychology.

     Instructions: Please watch this brief 2-minute video on Thorndike’s
    research with cat training.  It helps to clarify the Law of Effect
    based on animal research.  It also explains his rejection of insight
    as a foundation of learning and his emphasis on trial and error and
    reward.
