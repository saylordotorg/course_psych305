**Unit 11: Social Learning Theory and Applications** <span
id="11"></span> 
Social learning theory has an emphasis on the contexts of development. 
Contexts refer to the direct and indirect systems which affect human
individual development.  These are such direct influences as family and
peers, or other groups we are members.  However, it also looks at more
indirect systems such as communities and culture to understand how we
learn from our social environment, both directly and indirectly.  This
unit will explore how those contexts of development affect learning.
