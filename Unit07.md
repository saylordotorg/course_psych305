**Unit 7: J.B. Watson: The Original Behaviorist** <span id="7"></span> 
The work of John Watson is fraught with controversy due to his
questionable methods. Prior to the work of Watson, most research on
learning had been conducted with animals with an assumption that
learning was similar in humans.  This translation was easy to assume due
the early emphasis on observable behaviors as the only relevant data. 
Watson, with his controversial “Little Albert” research, made the
significant leap into human research.  Although many have called his
methodology unethical and inhumane, his research launched an entirely
new way to approach research and yielded significant findings,
particularly in human learning.

**7.1 John Watson, Controversial Researcher** <span id="7.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: York University: John Watson’s “Psychology as the
    Behaviorist Views it”**
    Link: York University: John Watson’s “[Psychology as the Behaviorist
    Views
    It](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/PSYCH305-7.1.pdf)”
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: This is a long paper written by Watson.  In it you
    will find not only his interest in the process of research, but his
    clear advocacy for the approach as the primary approach to studying
    behavior.  It contains many interesting concepts and terms and shows
    how he was both a researcher and philosopher.

**7.2 Fear and the Little Albert Experiment** <span id="7.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: University of Wisconsin’s “Classical Conditioning Part 3:
    Little Albert and the White Rat”**

    Rat](http://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/selflearn/Conditioning.htm)["](http://www.neuroanatomy.wisc.edu/selflearn/Conditioning.htm)
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please read the brief study overview.  This essay
    gives an excellent overview of one of Watson’s most controversial
    experiments, in which he induced fear of a white rat to an infant. 
    The study was done to demonstrate the process of conditioning, by
    pairing a white rat with a loud noise.

    Albert?”**

    Albert?](http://htpprints.yorku.ca/archive/00000198/01/BHARRIS.HTM)[”](http://psychology.about.com/od/classicpsychologystudies/a/little-albert-experiment.htm)(HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please read this entire article.  The Little Albert
    study was the first to examine the establishment of conditioned
    responses using a human participant.  While it represents one of the
    most famous (and many would claim as the most important)
    contributions to psychology, it is also widely acknowledged as one
    of the most unethical studies ever conducted.  As an aside, Watson
    was subsequently expelled from the American Psychological
    Association (APA) and shunned by his former colleagues.  He later
    entered the field of advertising on Madison Avenue and experienced
    great success using classical conditioning principles.  One such
    success involved selling Camel cigarettes by pairing friendly Joe
    the Camel with the “pleasures” of smoking.  He also coined the term:
    “I’d walk a mile for a Camel!”
