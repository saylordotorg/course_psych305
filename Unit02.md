**Unit 2: Philosophy and Psychology: Thinking about Learning** <span
id="2"></span> 
Learning theories may be thought of as a progression from philosophical
takes on introspection to specific theories developed to explain the
many ways that learning develops in animal and human organisms. 
Initially, learning was explained through the philosophical musings of
Aristotle and Plato, but in the late 1800s and early 1900s, scientists
such as John Watson argued that the best way to understand learning was
to study observable phenomena, not consciousness or the mind.  From that
perspective grew behaviorism, a strict focus on observable behaviors and
data gathering.  Although learning theory has greatly expanded from the
initial behaviorist perspectives to include areas such as social
learning theory and cognitive theory, the initial influence of
philosophy must not be overlooked.  In particular, the earlier
philosophical approaches are most integrated in the discussion of
ethical practices, particularly in the area of research.

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   <span dir="LTR">Identify differences between case study and
    traditional experimental studies of behavior.</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Explain the role of ethics in human and animal
    research.</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">List and explain the precursors of modern learning
    theories</span>

**2.1 Experimental Studies** <span id="2.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: ResearchMethodsinPsychology.com’s “Experimental and
    Non-experimental Research”**
    Link: ResearchMethodsinPsychology.com’s “[Experimental and
    Non-experimental
    Research](https://resources.saylor.org/wwwresources/archived/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/PSYCH305-2.1.pdf)”
    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Pay special attention to the pivotal strengths and
    limitations of each research approach.  While traditional
    experimental studies are considered desirable, it should be notes
    that case studies often include quantitative evidence.

    “Significance of Animal Research Behavior”**
    Link: Animal Behavior Society: Dr. Charles Snowdon’s “[Significance
    of Animal Research

     Instructions: The importance of animal research in the study of
    psychology cannot be overstated.  Although this type of research is
    often controversial, modern researchers, particularly in behavioral
    neuroscience, continue to rely on animal models to examine relevance
    to human behavior.
