**Unit 5: Behaviorism: Basic Concepts and Processes** <span
id="5"></span> 
Behaviorism, a specific subfield of psychology, has much to contribute
to learning theory.  Behaviorism’s emphasis on data collection and
observable behaviors has led to a deeper understanding of how humans
process information, particularly reinforcers and punishments.

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take 15 hours to complete.

    negative punishment.</span>

**5.1 Reinforcement and Shaping** <span id="5.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: AnimalBehavior.net: Judith K. Blackshaw’s “Learning
    Theory: Shaping”**
    Link: AnimalBehavior.net: Judith K. Blackshaw’s "[Learning Theory:
    Shaping"](http://animalbehaviour.net/Shaping.htm) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: The author of this brief work points out a vital
    component of providing reinforcement—the timing of the behavior and
    the reinforcement. A former professor of mine pointed out often the
    principle of “catch them when they are good” but also “catch them
    when they are bad.”  If your dog messes the carpet and four hours
    later you return from work, reprimanding the dog and rubbing the
    dog’s nose in the mess, you have effectively punished the dog for
    greeting you at the door!

**5.2 Punishment and Extinction** <span id="5.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: StrangeLoops.com’s “Controlling Behavior: Reward and
    Punishment”**
    Link: StrangeLoops.com’s ["Controlling Behavior: Reward and
    Punishment"](http://www.strange-loops.com/scicontingencies.html)
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: As the source paper notes, sometimes reinforcing
    behaviors, such as gambling, can have negative consequences such as
    losing all your money or becoming addicted.  You could use
    punishment to reduce the behavior.  For instance, if a gambler were
    to encounter a painful shock every time a coin was placed in a slot
    machine, this would result in a decrease in this behavior
    (hopefully!).  Alternately, we could simply prevent the machine from
    paying off (extinction), which is a better alternative if—and only
    if—the money received was truly the reinforcer.  If the person
    played because he liked to watch the wheels spin, the playing
    behavior would not be extinguished.  If you enjoy gambling (i.e.,
    losing money) and happen to become a psychologist, explain your
    presence at the slot machines and table games in a casino by saying
    you are not gambling, but, in fact, are “just doing research on
    behavioral principles and statistical probability theory!”

    (HTML)  
        
     Instruction: Please read this entire article.  Corporal punishment
    (i.e., spanking) is much more controversial in modern times than it
    was 50 years ago.  Now, parents who spank (especially in public)
    often are frowned upon.  This reading attempts to make the case
    against spanking, using learning principles as a platform.

     Instructions: Please read the entire article. The terms operational
    and instrumental learning are often considered to be synonymous.  A
    principal, and often confusing, distinction between the two is that
    “operant” refers the operations of the organism, while instrumental
    refers to the “Behavior—Reinforcement” connection.
