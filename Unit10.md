**Unit 10: Social Learning Theory** <span id="10"></span> 
This unit will also introduce you to vicarious learning, or the process
of learning that takes place when one observes or hears of another’s
learning.  Humans learn a great deal through vicarious learning and are
able to apply what they have learned to other situations through
generalization or discrimination.  This type of learning is also
described as “observational learning” and forms the basis of mentoring
and role modeling in contemporary psychology.

**Unit 10 Time Advisory**
