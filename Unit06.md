**Unit 6: Classical Conditioning vs. Operant Conditioning** <span
id="6"></span> 
Although learning theory has expanded far beyond classical conditioning
and operant conditioning, they are still the foundational hallmarks of
learning theory.  Together they form the basis of understanding how most
learning occurs.  Therefore, we will now closely examine these two types
of conditioning: classical (Pavlovian) and operant conditioning. 
Because operant conditioning is more complex than Pavlovian
conditioning, we will learn about different aspects of it over the
course of the next few units.  This unit will focus on the basics of
both classical conditioning, which focuses on the relation between
stimuli and responses and then, operant reinforcement, where an animal
encounters a specific consequence after performing a behavior and is
therefore either more or less likely to perform that behavior in the
future.  

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 3 hours to complete.

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   <span dir="LTR">Identify the fundamental processes of classical
    conditioning.</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Define the following terms associated with classical
    conditioning: unconditioned stimulus, conditioned stimulus,
    unconditioned response, and conditioned response.</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Identify the fundamental processes of operant
    conditioning.</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Define the following terms associated with operant
    conditioning: reinforcement, punishment, positive reinforcement and
    negative reinforcement.</span>
-   Explain two fundamental differences between classical and operant
    conditioning

     Instructions: This link has great basic information on classical
    conditioning.  As you begin to understand the basic concepts, you
    can investigate the site for examples and definitions of more
    advanced concepts.  Understanding the relations and development of
    conditioned stimuli and conditioned responses is key to
    understanding classical conditioning.
