**Unit 8: B.F. Skinner's Operant Conditioning** <span id="8"></span> 
We will now turn to a deeper look at a second type of conditioning:
operant conditioning.    This unit will focus on the work of B. F.
Skinner and his brand of operant conditioning, where an organism
encounters a specific consequence after performing a behavior and is
therefore either more or less likely to perform that behavior in the
future.   B. F. Skinners work and research was largely focused on humans
and translated well into interventions designed for classrooms and
parenting. 

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take 6 hours to complete.

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   <span dir="LTR">Define the characteristics of reinforcement in terms
    of behaviors and consequences.</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Define the difference between positive and negative
    reinforcement.</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Explain the process of extinction in operant
    conditioning and discuss how it differs from extinction in classical
    conditioning.</span>

    differences between reinforcement and punishment. There are a number
    of great real-world examples. In addition, this site has a nice set
    of references to previously addressed topics.
