**Unit 13: Real World Applications** <span id="13"></span> 
As educated consumers, we should strive to take our education and
effectively apply it to the everyday and real world applications. 
Psychology, particularly learning theory is incorporated into
significant aspects of mass media, formal and informal education and
family and relationships systems.  As educated consumers and citizens,
we should effectively understand how learning theory is integrated in
our lives and cultures.

**Unit 13 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 17 hours to complete.

**13.2 Is Racism Learned?** <span id="13.2"></span>

    the Deck Against Racism: A Psychological Explanation For
    Impartiality”**

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please read this entire article. The title of this
    article is somewhat misleading. Racism is one form of prejudice
    against or for a particular group based on some identifying
    characteristic. The student should be aware that prejudice is an
    attitude, while discrimination is a behavior, not necessarily based
    on prejudice. For example, I may dislike persons of Asian descent,
    and therefore refuse to hire them as police officers. However, if my
    police department has a minimum height policy for officers, Asians
    may be systematically discriminated against based simply on physical
    characteristics and not on prejudicial intent.

**13.6 Verbal Behaviors and the Development of Language** <span

-   **Reading: Northern Illinois University: Amy Bauer and Christine
    Maricich’s “B.F. Skinner, Behavioralism, & Language Behavior”**

    Maricich’s ["B.F. Skinner, Behavioralism & Language
    Behavior"](http://www3.niu.edu/acad/psych/Millis/History/2003/cogrev_skinner.htm)(HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please read this entire article. One of the more
    controversial issues related to behaviorism was the neglect of this
    paradigm in explaining mental processes that were not (according to
    behaviorists) directly observable and, thus, were not amenable to
    the “scientific” study of psychology.  Skinner attempted to address
    this issue in his book “Verbal Behavior,” which unfortunately led to
    more questions than answers.  As the authors note, a growing disdain
    for behaviorism after the publication of this book as being an
    insufficient model for explaining complex learning led to the rise
    of cognitive psychology and neuroscientific models.

    Box-and-Banana Problem"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDntbGRPeEU)
    (YouTube)  
        
      Instructions: Real laboratory footage showing a pigeon solving
    Wolfgang Kohler's famous box-and-banana problem, which he studied
    with chimpanzees in the early 1900s. Dr. Robert Epstein and his
    colleagues used operant conditioning techniques to get pigeons to
    solve this problem "spontaneously" in the 1980s.  Depending on their
    previous experience, pigeons could solve this problem in a
    human-like fashion in as little as a minute. This pigeon has learned
    to push boxes and to climb, and it has been rewarded with grain for
    pecking at a small toy banana. In this situation, the banana is out
    of reach and the box is not beneath it. At first the pigeon looks
    confused, then it begins pushing the box - sighting the toy banana
    as it pushes - and then stops pushing when the box is beneath the
    banana, then climbs and pecks.

**13.8 Superstitions** <span id="13.8"></span> 
-   **Web Media: PsychClassic’s “B.F Skinner’s Classic: Superstition in
    the Pigeon”**
    Link: PsychClassic’s [“B.F. Skinner's Classic: Superstition in the
    Pigeon”](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Skinner/Pigeon/) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please read the entire article.  B.F. Skinner studied
    the manner in which pigeons could be conditioned to develop
    superstitious behaviors. This behavior often is common in humans as
    well.  Often, for instance in baseball, players have certain
    mannerisms or ritualized routines that may have been associated with
    positive outcomes in the past. See the link below for examples.
