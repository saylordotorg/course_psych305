**Unit 1: Basic Concepts** <span id="1"></span> 
*Most of us think of learning in terms of traditional schooling and
education.  While learning theory includes educational learning,
“learning” as psychologists know it is much broader in scope. For them,
learning refers to the way in which an individual’s interaction with his
or her environment results in specific behaviors.  For psychologists,
“learning” references the knowledge of human interaction with the
environment to cause human behavior.   
    
 This unit will introduce you to the basic concepts and theoretical
underpinnings of learning theory and behaviorism.  In particular,
rationalism and empiricism are philosophical approaches to knowledge
development and provided the launching pad for future dialogue on
learning and thought.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take approximately 10 hours to complete.

**1.1 Rationalism and Empiricism** <span id="1.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Garth Kemerling’s *Philosophy Pages*: “René Descartes”**
    Link: Garth Kemerling’s *Philosophy* *Pages*: [“René
    Descartes”](http://www.philosophypages.com/ph/desc.htm) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Rationalism embodies the idea the knowledge derives
    from reason alone. Thus, the senses are not primary factors in
    knowledge development. The rationalist doctrine was espoused by René
    Descartes during the mid 1600s. His primary methodology included
    doubt, and he gave us the famous phrase, “I think, therefore I am.”
    Review this history of Descartes’ life and discover the foundations
    of “thinking about thinking.”
