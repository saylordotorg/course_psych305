**Unit 4: Pavlov Classical Conditioning** <span id="4"></span> 
Conditioning refers to learning that takes place over a number of
trials.  In this unit, we will learn about Pavlovian conditioning (also
known as Classical conditioning), a specific type of conditioning that
the psychologist Ivan Pavlov proved during a set of experiments.  We
will learn how Pavlovian conditioning takes place and how it is
maintained, reviewing ways in which this type of conditioning applies to
human behavior. 

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take 8 hours to complete.
