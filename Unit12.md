**Unit 12: Cognitive Theory** <span id="12"></span> 
Cognitive theory emphasis how development affects cognition, or the
thinking process.  Naturally, this is an important aspect of learning. 
Cognitive theory rose in status as a rebuttal to strict behaviorism.  It
was noted that human development took a path such that human brains
could not be subtracted from the process of learning to only focus on
rewards and behaviors.  Age, mood, affect and personality also interact
strongly with the learning process.   Cognitive theory helps us
understand the internal processes of thought and behavior.   The seminal
theorist, Jean Piaget helped revolutionize how we think about child
development by asserting that “Children are not merely small adult
thinkers.”

**Unit12 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   <span dir="LTR">List the primary domains of cognitive
    psychology.</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Define the primary stages of development according
    to Piaget.</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Explain the qualitative differences between Piaget’s
    four stages of human development: sensorimotor, preoperational,
    concrete and formal operations.</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">Articulate the integration of social contexts into
    cognitive theory, through the perspective of Lev Vygotsky.</span>

**12.1 Deprivation and Human Behavior** <span id="12.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Whyfiles.com’s “The Science of Mother’s Day”**
    Link: Whyfiles.com’s [“The Science of Mother’s
    Day”](http://whyfiles.org/087mother/4.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please read the entire article.  It is a review of
    how internal motivations affect cognitions and decision-making.  It
    supports the perspective in cognitive theory that internal moods and
    affect effect outward behavior.  It explores deprivation as it
    relates to the deprivation in early orphanages and emphases the
    importance of the early caregiver relationship and attachment.

**12.2 Drive Reduction Theory** <span id="12.2"></span>

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please read this entire webpage.  Hull’s work was
    perhaps neglected in the larger scheme of behaviorism, but there are
    great concepts to be learned in the area of childhood education.

     Instructions: This page is short but takes some careful reading. 
    Students are encouraged to diagram some of the possible scenarios
    that arise from these somewhat conflicting views of what motivates
    learning.
